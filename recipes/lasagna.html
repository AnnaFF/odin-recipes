    <h3>Decsription</h3>
    <p>A typical lasagna recipe involves layering flat pasta sheets with a seasoned meat sauce and a creamy cheese mixture (often ricotta and/or béchamel), topped with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese, and then baking until golden and bubbly. The process starts by preparing the meat sauce by browning ground meat with onions and garlic, then simmering it with tomato sauce and seasonings. Meanwhile, lasagna noodles are boiled until al dente, and the cheese filling is prepared. The dish is assembled by layering the meat sauce, noodles, and cheese mixture, and baked until done</p>
